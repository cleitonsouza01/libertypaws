🚨 Follow ALL Project Constraints

You SHOULD create a implementation plan file and update it as you go, at @docs/implementation-reports/


📌 Create a pre-change safety commit:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: pre-implementation [$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')]"
````

Make sure test using MCP Playwright
